# Laralol

This is a Laravel package which let you faster getting data from League of Legends API. It is my first package, if you want, you can open new issues and give me a clues what I can do better. This API now is available only with facades, but I planning let developers use global functions for call endpoints. Now you can install this package with only master branch, if I will end this package, make a tag and will be v1, now is beta.

## Getting Started

Install this package with packagist.

### Installing

Type with you terminal:

```
composer require devtemple/lara-lol
```

### Set API key
Open your *.env* file and set a ``` LARALOL_API_KEY ``` which you can generate on the League of Legends developers API page

### Options
You can export config files:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laralol-config
```

Default server:
```
default_server
```

Default season:
```
default_season
```

Possible is define server with every new call endpoint with function:

```
server($server)
```

ex.
```
use Devtemple\Laralol\Facades\Champion;

Champion::server('euw1')->get();
```

### How use
League of Legends API giving use some endpoint to get different data from the RIOT servers.

Every call to endpoint require one function:
```
get($fields)
```

If you want, you can set attribute with fields you want get from the call. You can define array with fields or one field. You can set it empty and get all data from the endpoint.

ex.
```
get('field') or get(['field1', 'field2']) or get()
