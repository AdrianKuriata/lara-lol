# Laralol

This is a Laravel package which let you faster getting data from League of Legends API. It is my first package, if you want, you can open new issues and give me a clues what I can do better. This API now is available only with facades, but I planning let developers use global functions for call endpoints. Now you can install this package with only master branch, if i will end this package, make a tag and will be v1, now is beta.

## Getting Started

### Options
You can export config files:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laralol-config
```

Possible is define server with every new call endpoint with function:

```
